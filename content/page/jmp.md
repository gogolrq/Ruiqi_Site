##### 2. Statistical Inference on Partially Linear Panel Model under Unobserved Linearity
**Abstract:** A new statistical procedure,  based on a modified spline basis, is proposed to identify the linear components in the panel data model with fixed effects. Under some mild assumptions, the proposed procedure is shown to consistently estimate  the underlying regression function,  correctly select the linear components, and effectively conduct the statistical inference. When compared to existing methods for detection of  linearity in panel model, our approach is demonstrated to be  theoretically justified as well as  practically convenient. We  provide a computational algorithm which implements the proposed procedure along with a path-based solution  method for linearity detection, which avoids the burden of selecting the tuning parameter for the penalty term. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of our proposed procedure with detailed findings that confirm our theoretical results in the paper. Application to  Aggregate Production Data also illustrates the necessity for detecting  linearity in the partially linear panel model.

##### 3. Optimal Nonparametric Inference via Deep Neural Network
**Abstract:** Deep neural network is a state-of-art method in modern science and technology. Much statistical literature have been devoted to understanding its 
performance in nonparametric estimation, whereas the results are suboptimal due to a redundant logarithmic sacrifice. In this paper, we show that such log-factors are not necessary. We derive upper bounds for the \\( L^2 \\) minimax risk in nonparametric estimation. Sufficient conditions on network architectures are provided such that the upper bounds become optimal (without log-sacrifice). Our proof relies on an explicitly constructed network estimator based on tensor product B-splines.
We also derive asymptotic distributions for the constructed network and a relating hypothesis testing procedure. The testing procedure is further proven as minimax optimal under suitable network architectures.
