##### 2. Statistical Inference on Partially Linear Panel Model under Unobserved Linearity
**Keywords:** Linearity Detection, Shrinkage Estimation, Partially Linear Panel
</br>
**Summary:** We develop a method to automatically detect the linear components in partially linear panel when the linearity of regressors is unknown.
